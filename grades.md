### Finding your grades

Detailed marking scheme information will be pushed to your assignment repository.  Summary marks will be found on the CS Student [web site](https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/students/)

There is no way to automatically update these marks as changes are made, so changes to your assignment or lab marks may take a while to appear on this site.


### Remarks
Please use the  [remark request form](https://wwwcgi.cdf.utoronto.ca/~cs309hf/cgi-bin/remark-request.cgi?course=csc309h) for remark requests.  Include specific information about what you think the TA marked incorrectly.
