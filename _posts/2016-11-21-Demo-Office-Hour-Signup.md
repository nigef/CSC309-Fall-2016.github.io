### Demo signup
Please fill in your group name to sign up for a [demo time slot](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AFmuilXFrkzx697kKci5hECJKAh1xQ4jgPB9hYjrPwc/edit#gid=0).

Note that we tried to use the course lab time slots for most of the demos.  This should make it easier to ensure that everyone from your group can attend.

**The demos are not optional and all members of your group must attend and participate.**

### Project Office hours

There is also a [schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZIwgBjx4t7mBz3AqPD28Z9qHfLGb-PbzQNAmScTbHbU/edit#gid=172253725) for TA office hours set up.  Please sign up under the appropriate tab for office hours with your TA.  It will help them to know who is planning to come.  By default, the TAs will go to BA 2270.
