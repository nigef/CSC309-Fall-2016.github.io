The final exam is closed book.  No aids allowed.  The [final page](/lectures/w12/aid.pdf) of the exam has a few reminders of JavaScript, JQuery and Express basic functions.

There will be some programming on the final exam, with the focus on vanilla JavaScript. You should understand how the JavaScript language works to the extent that we covered it in class.

The majority of the exam takes the form of short answer questions.

There are 8 questions worth a total of 73 marks.
