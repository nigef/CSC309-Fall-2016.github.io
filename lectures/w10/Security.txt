Irving's talk

Security matters 
- physical safety matters too, if you leak information about your users you could put them at risk.


Three pillars of security:
Confidentiality
Integrity
Availability (DOS, something your system depends on is attacked so it affects your ability to provide your service)

Risks
- 
Threats - involve some kind of human actors
    
- Someone who works for you might leak information
- Insider plugs in an an unknown USB key and can inadvertently get malware on the internet

- Law Enforcement
    - How much should computer industry support Law Enforcement?
    - how much data should I keep in my logs and what kinds of information do you save about your user
    
- People/organizations out for financial gain 
    - resell stolen passwords, credit card numbers, info about users 
    - black market in stolen info about users
- vandals - out there to cause damage


All sorts of attack
- attakcers don't have to change anything about your software to get at your users (XSS, CSRF)
(Need to talk more about exactly what XSS and CSRF are ?)

Environment
- trust relationships between user/computer/browser, your server, other servers (DNS, CDNs, etc)
- typical example of MITM profiling  is wifi in a coffee shop (need to explain how)
- drive-by-download

TLS  and HTTPS - 
- 
Heartbleed - take advantage of options in the protocol?
    - find a reference
    
Make security as simple as possible.

Authentication
- what does salt and hash mean?

drawback to social login is that giving info to provider.  E.g. FB knows that you are using "abc.com"

OAuth (how does it work?)

Explain PubKey 
forensics - importance of logging activities

Authorization:
- hard work to check every operation 

Injection- SQL injection
    - can send to any interpreter

SQL - parameter substituion instead of string concatenation

A2 - Broken auth
    - use ssl
    - session ids exposed...
A3 -
