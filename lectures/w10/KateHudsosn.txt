Kate Hudso - Data Driven decision-making

- JavaScript Expert

Firefox - 9-12 million lines of code
    - 350 million users
Firefox engineering - 200 browser team
    - Kate sub-team of 10


- Broad-street pump
    - cholera outbreak in 1850's
    - sewage system was contaminated
    - prevailing theory was that diseases spread by miasma (cloud of sickness)
    - John Snow - made a dot map of the deaths and the well - relate them to the pumps
    - after shutting off the pump they learned that the hypothesis of spread of cholera related to water
    
- Quality assurance and monitoring

Healthy software?
- doesn't crash (very often)
- trust data
- preserves data
- easy to use
- performance
- able to handle error states gracefully


What do we monitor?
- monitor cpu, memory, #crashes
- look at HTTP response code (500, 400)

Releasing new code
- if code changes from healthy to unhealthy - big problem
- prevent this
    - canary release pattern - change one server, check the monitoring, easy to pull it out if something goes wrong?

What about client-side applications?
    - staged roll-out - choose a small group of users and roll out update to them
    - must be able to split users into groups or cohorts
    - group of people who share a defining characteristic
    - who gets new code - just by percentage
    - by single country/language  (usually not en-us)
    - opt-in release channels - beta channel
        - consent given, so we can ask to collect more data
        - able to ask for extra things like bug reports, feedback
        - users are expecting some instability

E.g. Blizzard Public Test Round
    Android - beta channel
    Firefox - beta, nightly, aurora (explaining)
    
Prefs - (about:config in Firefox )
    - off/on switches for experiments
Test Pilot - add-on 
    - test new features for firefox
    
Version control for multiple releases
    "Version control is the coolest thing in the world (other than Overwatch)"

     - process on SE team to make sure branch for each release
     
User engagement metrics (user behaviour)
    -  Metrics "pings"
        - Showed us some charts
        - mau wau dau (monthly, daily active users)
        - track user retention
        - can directly write sql queries on the metrics database

Experiment in product development
- release experimental products
- Mozilla - Focus - keep browsing anonymous
    - how much does this matter to users?
    - how much do users care about privacy data

Multivarient AB testing
- have a control group and an experiment cohort
- users unaware of participateion
- run one experimenat at a time
- must run long enough so that statistical signifcance
    - aim for 90-95% certainty
    - need a lot of users to do this
- results must be correlated with right metrics - sometimes unexpected effects
- sometimes conclude that neither is more effective
- sometimes see unexpected effects - e.g. a huge drop in engagement
    (makes designers sad - humbling)
- novelty effect

Ethical consideration
    - impact of performance on user engagement
    - negatively affect performance in a small way
        - makeing someone's browsers slower just for an experiment is unethical
    - decided not to do that experiment
