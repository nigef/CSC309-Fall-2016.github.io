## Working Environment

You will be using GitHub repositories to manage your assignments. Your life will be considerably easier if you read and follow the instructions for working on and submitting your assignment.

You will want to spend some time learning how to use Git and GitHub if you are not already familiar with it. The [GitHub Guides](https://help.github.com) are a pretty good place to start.

You will need a GitHub id. This means that you should be thinking about privacy issues. The repositories that you will use for the course are private in the sense that only you, your team mates (for the project), the TAs, and I will be able to see the repo on GitHub. For many people there is really nothing to worry about in using the same GitHub id for the course and for other work that you do, especially since
GitHub has a pretty strong [privacy policy](https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/).

However, you might have a reason not to associate your personal GitHub use with the course, or vice versa, and in that case you may want to create a GitHub id for school use. You will need to use a valid email address, and I will need a way to identify who you are, so if you don't trust GitHub to protect your email address, then we will have to talk.
